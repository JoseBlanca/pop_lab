## Balancing selection with different selective preasures


Selection in both populations

Set fitness values that creates the same selection preasure in both populations in favor of the A allele. What happens with the A allelic frequency and the diversity? Does the migration beteween both populations influence something?
Balancing selection

Let's imagine that now we have selection favoring the A allele in one population and the a allele in the other. We can assume that A is dominant. This would be the case, for instance, of a wild and a cultivated population living in the same area. There will be some crosses between them, so some gene flow, and one allele (for instance in a fruit size gene) will be favored in the wild population and the other will be selected in the cultivated one.

This is also the case in a cultivated species in which some varieties are selected from some fruit size, shape, or color and other for others.

Let's try starting with the following settings:

Pop. 1:

    Freq. A = 1
    WAA = 1
    WAa = 1
    waa = 0.7
    imigration = 0.06

Pop. 2:

    Freq. A = 0
    WAA = 0.7
    WAa = 0.7
    waa = 1
    imigration = 0.06

What happens now with the diversity in both populations?

How does the diversity respond to different selective preasures?

Could we fix the cultivated allele in the cultivated population while there are still crosses with the wild population? How does migration affects this situation?

## Imbreeding

The ancestral population will not disapear, so both populations will exist at generation 0 (present day).

## Mutation-drift and diversities

Analyze the influence of the population size in the number or markers and in the number of polymorfic markers. Plot the different diversity indexes for populations of sizes: 500, 1000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 500000

    How does the number of markers change with the population size?
    How does the diversity, and number of polymorphic markers change with population size?
    How does the proportion of polymorphic markers and Allele Frequency Spectrum change with population size?
