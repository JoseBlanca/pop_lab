# Practices

## Selection

### Minor recessive allele (aa) advantage

This is the case of a new benefitial mutation.

Do simulations starting with mostly AA genotypes and a minimum amount of Aa, and set the fitness of wAA and wAa to different levels from (0.1 to 1).

Which is the fate of the A and a alleles?

Run the simulation several times. Does the a allele always manages to be fixed in the end? Why?

Make the population infinite to remove the drift effect and write down number of generations in which the a allele is fixed

### Minor deletereous allele

This is a common example in genetic diseases.

Start mostly with AA genotypes and a minimum amount of Aa, and set the fitness of waa to different levels from (0.1 to 1) and wAA and WAa to 1 (a is recessive).

Does the deletereous allele disapears from the population? (Try with and without drift).

What happens when if we make the disease dominant? (wAa = waa)

In the case of a dominant disadvantage what happens when this dissadvantage is very low? (wAA=1, wAa=0.9, waa=0.9)

### Heterozygote superiority, the malaria case

Set wAA=0.8, wAa=1, and waa=0.4. What happens in this case?

Try with different fitness values, and study what happens with the allelic and genotypic frequencies.

### Heterozygote inferiority

Simulate the existance of a big chromosomal inversion that impairs the heterozygotes reproduction. WAA=Waa=1, different values of wAa.

What happens in an infinite population? And in a population with 1000 indiviuals?

For this case, study also the effect of introducing selfing.

## Balancing selection with different selective preasures


Selection in both populations

Set fitness values that creates the same selection preasure in both populations in favor of the A allele. What happens with the A allelic frequency and the diversity? Does the migration beteween both populations influence something?
Balancing selection

Let's imagine that now we have selection favoring the A allele in one population and the a allele in the other. We can assume that A is dominant. This would be the case, for instance, of a wild and a cultivated population living in the same area. There will be some crosses between them, so some gene flow, and one allele (for instance in a fruit size gene) will be favored in the wild population and the other will be selected in the cultivated one.

This is also the case in a cultivated species in which some varieties are selected from some fruit size, shape, or color and other for others.

Let's try starting with the following settings:

Pop. 1:

    Freq. A = 1
    WAA = 1
    WAa = 1
    waa = 0.7
    imigration = 0.06

Pop. 2:

    Freq. A = 0
    WAA = 0.7
    WAa = 0.7
    waa = 1
    imigration = 0.06

What happens now with the diversity in both populations?

How does the diversity respond to different selective preasures?

Could we fix the cultivated allele in the cultivated population while there are still crosses with the wild population? How does migration affects this situation?

## Imbreeding

The ancestral population will not disapear, so both populations will exist at generation 0 (present day).

## Mutation-drift and diversities

Analyze the influence of the population size in the number or markers and in the number of polymorfic markers. Plot the different diversity indexes for populations of sizes: 500, 1000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 500000

    How does the number of markers change with the population size?
    How does the diversity, and number of polymorphic markers change with population size?
    How does the proportion of polymorphic markers and Allele Frequency Spectrum change with population size?
