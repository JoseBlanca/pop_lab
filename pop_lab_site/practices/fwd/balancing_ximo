## selección en una población y en otra no

Two populations with a migration rate of 0.05 beewten them are in HW with a initial A frequence of 0.5. In the A population the fitness oa aa change to 0 by the presence of a new predator, but the predator is not present in the B population and maintain the same fitness for all gneotypes. The `population size are 200 for both populations

How the genotype frequences change in both poplations? Do you expected this result? Why?
