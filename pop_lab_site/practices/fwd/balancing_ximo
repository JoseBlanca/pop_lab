## selección en una población y en otra no

Two populations with a migration rate of 0.05 beewten them are in HW with a initial A frequence of 0.5. In the A population the fitness oa aa change to 0 by the presence of a new predator, but the predator is not present in the B population and maintain the same fitness for all gneotypes. The `population size are 200 for both populations

How the genotype frequences change in both poplations? Do you expected this result? Why?

The tax of migration from A to B has de same effect than B to A?


## Migration to avoid specialition

Two populations have different selecting presure from A and a alleles. The A polation has a fitness for aa=0 and B population AA=0. Both in HW and infinite size. Could be the migration  able to maintain present all alleles in both populations? With that level of migration tax?  Do you expect both homizigotes in both populations?
