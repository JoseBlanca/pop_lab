## NHW no le veo el sentido,al hacer hw en la generacion 2 ya no se ve luego nada diferente

## Aparece una mutación nueva que es mas efizaz que el alelo antiguo

In a popluation with infinite size and was fixed with aa genotype a new mutation arrives with a initial frecuence of 0.01. Could be better to expand this mutation in the population a bigger fitness to AA o Aa? Test it ans explain
What is the relation between fitness difference and number generations to arrive to equilibrium?

## el alelo deletereo sigue apareciendo por mutacion
If  this infinity population the mutation tax from a to A is 0.005, do you expect than A frequency increase or decreases along time? Finally the genotypic frecuencies arrived to a equilibrium? Could you test other mutation rates and fitness to give a global response? Could you explain the results?


## Heterozigoto letal sin y con deriva

In a population with infinite size in HW with A frequency of 0.5 arrives a new virus that is letal in the Aa indivuals. What genotypes frecuences do you expect if exist random matting?. Could you explain the result?

Did you expect the same result with a non infinite population?


## alelo mutante se mantiene en heterozigosis en la población con deriva y sin deriva
In a popluation with infinite size and HW equilibrium the A frequency is 0.06. The fitness of Aa and aa is 1 but the AA homozigotes have a fitness of 0.8. Do you think that the A allele disappear in less than 50 generations?
After 200 generations? 1000 generations?
If the AA genotype is lethal, is similar the result?
Do you have similar results if the population size is not infinite? Test with 100 individuals population several times. Why is different?
