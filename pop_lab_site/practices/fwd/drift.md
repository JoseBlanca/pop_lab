# Drift practice

## Introduction

In this practice, we will simulate the evolution of a locus with two alleles (A and a).
You will be able to modify the initial allelic frequency of A and the number of generations.
We will assume that genotypic frequencies follow Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

In this simulations, there are no mutation or selection—just a population of a given size evolving generation after generation through random mating.
Finally, you can choose to run one or multiple simulations simultaneously.

## Randomness

What do you think will happen if a population with an initial A allelic frequency of 0.5 and 100 individuals evolves over 100 generations?
Does evolution always follow the same pattern when you run the simulation multiple times? Why or why not?

## Fixation

Evolve a population of 100 individuals over 100 generations.
Run the simulation 20 times and count how many times an allele becomes fixed.

What happens if, instead of 100 generations, the population evolves for 300 generations?
What do you think would eventually happen if we ran the simulation for thousands of generations?

When fixation occurs, is one allele more likely to be fixed than another?
Change the initial A allelic frequency to 0.9 and compare the results with the 0.5 case.

What usually happens to alleles at very low frequencies in the population?
Could an allele with a low initial frequency increase its frequency over time?


## Population Size Influence

How does the number of individuals affect the differences between evolutionary outcomes?
Do the differences between trials increase or decrease with changes in population size?

How does population size influence the likelihood of fixation?
Run simulations with populations of 200 individuals for 100 generations and compare the results with those for 100 and for 50 individuals.

What happens if we assume, as in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, that the population is infinite?

## Drift and Diversity

Now that you have explored allelic frequency behavior, can you predict how expected heterozygosity changes over time?

If we start with an A allelic frequency of 0.5, can the expected heterozygosity increase?
Can genetic drift increase diversity?
What would eventually happen to diversity if we ran the simulation for many generations?

If we started with an A allelic frequency of 1, could drift alone generate diversity?


## Ximo's original verion

We are simulating one locus with two alleles.

1. First simulate the frecuency variation along the time in a big population (1000 individuals) and 100 generations. 

    · The  genotypic graphic is that you expected? 

    · Will be the result similar if you run again the simulation? Why?

2. Reduce the population size to 100 and run the similation 10 times. Save the genotypic frecuences obtained in each simulation.

    · How times the allele A is fixed or lost?

3. Increased the number of generation to 500 and repeat the 10 simulations.

    · The results are similars to a 100 generations?

4. What happened if the frequence of A will be 0.8? Simulate 10 times with a small and a big population.

    · Compare and explain the results. 

5. Locking the Freq A graphic, could you predict the behavior of the expected heterozygosity graphics?.

    · Test it several times with a small population and diferent A frequencies.

6. A population of a special variety of plant with a rare allele in the rest of populations has 1000 individuals. But a route will be constucted in the population site, What could be the minimum population size that have to remain to mantain the allele if the initial frequence of the 'a' alleles is 0.2?
